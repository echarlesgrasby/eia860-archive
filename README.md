# eia860-archive
This is intended to archive EIA-860 generator parameter files from the Energy Information Authority in support of my dissertation work. 

## Source

These files were initially sourced from this repository (publicly) available from the [EIA 860 Webpage](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/).
They are placed on the EIA website as .zip files. These were downloaded and extracted into flat folder layouts before uploading to this repository.
